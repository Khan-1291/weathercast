This version:
- Uses **keyword-rich phrases** like "real-time weather app", "OpenWeather API", "responsive web design" for search.
- Has a **tags section** so GitHub search can pick it up for relevant queries.
- Keeps a **professional but eye-catching layout** for first-time visitors.

If you want, I can also write you a **short GitHub repository description** and **topics** so that your repo ranks higher instantly when you publish it. That’s the line and tags shown **above the README** on GitHub.
